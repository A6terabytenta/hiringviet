						<p>When I first brought my cat home from the humane society

							forty dollars. And then I had to buy litter, a litterbox, food,
							and dishes for her to eat out of. Two days after she came home
							with me she got taken to the pound by the animal warden. There's
							a leash law for cats in Fort Collins. If they're not in your yard
							they have to be on a leash. Anyway, my cat is my best friend. I'm
							glad I got her. She sleeps under the covers with me when it's
							cold. Sometimes she meows a lot in the middle of the night and
							wakes me up, though. (unfocused)</p>
						<p>When I first brought my cat home from the Humane Society
							she was a mangy, pitiful animal. She was so thin that you could
							count her vertebrae just by looking at her. Apparently she was
							declawed by her previous owners, then abandoned or lost. Since
							she couldn't hunt, she nearly starved. Not only that, but she had
							an abscess on one hip. The vets at the Humane Society had drained
							it, but it was still scabby and without fur. She had a terrible
							cold, too. She was sneezing and sniffling and her meow was just a
							hoarse squeak. And she'd lost half her tail somewhere. Instead of
							tapering gracefully, it had a bony knob at the end. (focused)</p>
